# About
This 'master' repository will hold the final and production-quality code for some personal projects on Deep Learning models that I will start working on.

# Project: A Speech Recognition model for Burushaski Language
For the purposes of learning and testing my newly acquired skills, I will start working on an NLP model for a speech recognition software that will recognise and translate my mother tongue, Burushaski, into English. And, if I succeed, I will train the model to translate my language into other languages as well. 

# Note to Self:
I'll improve my repo and this README file as soon as I have some substantial amount of code or a preliminary model.
