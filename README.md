# About
This 'master' repository will hold the final and production-quality code for some personal projects on Deep Learning models that I will start working on.

# Project: A text-based translation model for Burushaski Language
I am excited to begin a project focused on the development of an NLP model for translation software. The primary objective of my work will be to create a model capable of translating Burushaski, a language isolate predominantly spoken in the Hunza Valley, Nagar, and Yasin, into English. My long-term objective is to expand the model to include other regional languages of Gilgit-Baltistan. While I may not possess expertise in this field, I am eager to learn and develop my skills throughout the course of this project. I anticipate that this project will require a considerable amount of time and effort, but I am fully committed to achieving a successful outcome. Any guidance or support related to deep learning, ML, NLP, or other related topics would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your assistance.  

# Note to Self:
I'll improve my repo and this README file as soon as I have some substantial amount of code or a preliminary model.
